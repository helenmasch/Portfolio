      <p>Hi there! My name is Helen. I am currently enrolled in the full stack coding bootcamp at University of Pennsylvania for web development. My experience includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIâ€™s, and Node. I am a problem solver and go-getter that is constantly finding ways to improve my coding and skillsets.</p>

      <p>My previous education includes a Bachelor of Arts in Communication and Media Studies from Cabrini University. I have worked for over 10 years in various diverse departments within the fashion industry. In addition, my skill sets includes working within the travel industry as a marketing associate and the automotive industry at one of the top sustainability companies in the world. My hopes in completing this course is to add another skill set onto my previous experience as well as take my career to the next level. </p>
